        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Adarsh Tank. I am from surat. i am studdying in Information Technology.
            I am currently studying in third year of College.
            I like to learn new things.
            I also like to travel.
            I Am Making this Mini Project Under AWP Subject
            1. I followed my heart.
        Life is short and everyone has something that they are passionate about. Be able to say that you didn't let fear hold you back. The cost of not following your heart is spending the rest of your life wishing you had.

        2. I believe in myself.
        Even if you fail, it doesn't mean you will continue to fail. Be able to say you believed in yourself and kept trying. Everything that is successful will begin with you believing in yourself.

        3. I live by high standards.
        Never apologize for high standards; people who really want to be in your life will rise up to meet them. The quality of who you are is reflected in the standards you set for yourself; position yourself to live up to the rise of your own expectations. 

        4. I treat others the way I want to be treated.
        Talk to people the way you want to be spoken to; respect people as you wish to be respected. Your status, religion, race, political views, or culture don't matter--being a good person really is as simple as following the golden rule and treating others as you would like them to treat you.

        5. I understand how precious time is.
        Be able to say that you didn't waste time. Remember that time is free but priceless, that you can't own it but you can spend it--wisely or unwisely. Treat time as a resource to be invested carefully.

        6. I look for positivity in all things.
        Instead of thinking of all the things that can go wrong, become one of the people who look on how they go right. Your mind is powerful, and when you fill it with positivity your life naturally becomes positive. When you think positive thoughts, positive things will happen.

        7. I trust my intuition.
        Don't let anyone talk you out of what you know to be true. Trust your inner voice and allow yourself to be led by your intuition. The  more empowered you become, the stronger you become and the happier you become. Avoid going against your better judgment or getting talked into things that don't feel right.

        8. I speak up.
        When you don't speak up for the things that matter to you, you are not being true to yourself. When you speak your mind, you stand with confidence and gain courage.

        9. I am a tough person who has made it through tough times.
        The times when life is toughest are often the times that lead you to the most meaningful discoveries. When times are tough, dare to be tougher. Anyone can run away, but facing problems and working through them makes you strong.

        10. I am good at letting people know they matter.
        No matter how busy you are, make time to let people know they matter. Be there for them, make plans with them, set aside time for relationships.
